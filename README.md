### The Science of Communication

People don't just differ in *what* information they want—they differ in *how* they process information. Sentymail's proprietary algorithms identify individual cognitive preferences based on:

- **Personality frameworks** that shape information processing
- **Representational systems** (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) 
- **Communication patterns** revealed through linguistic analysis

Our LLM-powered technology analyzes existing customer interactions to build scientifically-backed communication personas that dramatically increase engagement.
